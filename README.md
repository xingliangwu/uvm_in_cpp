# uvm_in_cpp
## abstractive
Have been working as an design & verification engineer for years, I enjoyed uvm experience.
Recently I changed my career path to performance modeling and microarchitecture design.
Still in silicon industry, I missed the uvm features. I was like, why not uvm in C++? Therefore this project is made.
### What to expect in this project
Most likely only stuffs I need for modeling. Like uvm_reg model, would be nice to have that in C++.
### What's likely not to be included
The actual verification part. Well, uvm is for verification. I shouldn't call this project uvm_in_cpp at the begining. It's inspired by uvm in systemverilog. The main purpose is to create hardware modeling in C++, while one can still enjoy the uvm features. Like uvm_driver/uvm_monitor/uvm_sequence are likely not to be implemented in this project.
## Current plan
The following items are in current plan:
- uvm_object
- uvm_reg model
- TLM
- uvm_printer
- uvm_comparer
- uvm_phase
